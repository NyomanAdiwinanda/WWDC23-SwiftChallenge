# What is Flag Semaphore?

Flag Semaphore is a method of sending signals or messages using simple tools, such as flags. This method is carried out by saving both hands to form a certain position according to a predetermined formation. Flags play a role in clarifying the direction of hand movements when conveying messages.

Semaphores are useful as a way to communicate remotely. This method is one of the materials taught and must be memorized by all participants in scout activities. The goal is for scout members to be able to communicate from a long distance, even if they are camping in a place where the signal is difficult, such as in a mountain or in a remote village.
